            ## Build Instructions

            Due to copyright restrictions, pre-built game JARs are not included.
            RDForward uses a **BuildTools** approach (like Spigot) where the original
            RubyDung code is downloaded and decompiled on your machine.

            ### Quick Start

            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/martinambrus/RDForward.git
            cd RDForward
            git checkout ${{ github.ref_name }}

            # First-time setup: downloads rd-132211 from Mojang, decompiles, applies patches
            ./gradlew :rd-game:setupWorkspace

            # Build everything
            ./gradlew build

            # Launch the game
            ./gradlew :rd-game:runClient
            ```

            ### Requirements
            - Java 21+ (for building)
            - Internet connection (first build only, to download rd-132211.jar from Mojang)
